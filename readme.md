# GMR - Motorsport Management Game

A text-based motorsport management simulation game written in Python. Build your racing team from a humble garage inheritance in 1947 and compete in the chaotic world of early Grand Prix racing.

## Description

In GMR, you inherit your father's old racing chassis and a worn engine, starting with a small shed and a single mechanic. Navigate the post-war motorsport scene, where there are no official championships, minimal safety, and fierce competition from marques like Enzoni.
