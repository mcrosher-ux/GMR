      # Step 3: Install dependencies
      # We upgrade pip first, then install requirements if the file exists.
      # We also install 'flake8' (linter) and 'pytest' (test runner) for checking.

      # Step 4: Lint with Flake8
      # This checks for syntax errors (undefined names, bad indentation).
      # It stops the build if there are critical errors (E9, F63, F7, F82).
